<h1> Deep Learning Datasets </h1>
<h4>The Database of Faces</h4>
<p>
Our Database of Faces, (formerly 'The ORL Database of Faces'), contains a set of face images taken between 
April 1992 and April 1994 at the lab. The database was used in the context of a face recognition project 
carried out in collaboration with the Speech, Vision and Robotics Group of the Cambridge University Engineering Department.
</br>
There are ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some subjects, the images were 
taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) 
and facial details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with 
the subjects in an upright, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement). A preview image of the Database 
of Faces is available on kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kasikrit/att-database-of-faces">Here</a>.
